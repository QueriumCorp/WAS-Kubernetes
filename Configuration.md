# Configuration

After setting up the Wolfram Application Server, there are various modifications that may be applied to customize your deployment. This file documents the commonly used configurations for mofifying the applicaiton server.

## Passwords

### Restart API
_It is highly recommended to change the password for the restart API._

The restart api used to force the restart of the Wolfram Engine pools is protected with basic HTTP authentication requiring a user name and password. Wolfram Application Server deploys a default password for the user **applicationserver** specified in the file `Source/ingress/auth` on the deployment machine. The format of the password file is generated by the Apache [htpasswd](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html) applicaiton. To generate a new encrypted password navigate to the ingress directory and run the following command:

`htpasswd -c ./auth applicationserver`

You will be prompted for a new password. The `htpasswd` command may additionally be used further customize the password file with new users and passwords as desired.

To deploy the modified `auth` password file to the cluster  run the following command:

`kubectl create secret generic basic-auth --from-file=auth -n was --ignore-not-found=true`

to apply the changes.


##  Kernel Initialization

Developers may wish to run Wolfram Language code when Wolfram Engine kenels are initialized prior to handling user requests. By convention this code should be deployed as a node file named `init.wl` to one of the following paths

* `.Wolfram/Kernel/init.wl`
* `.Wolfram/[pool name]/Kernel/init.wl`

Configuration files deployed to the first location will be run for all kernels in all pools. Configurations deployed to the second will be run only for the pool specified by `[pool name]` to permit customizing initialization code for each pool.

##  Pod Scaling
### List of Pods
* Active Web Elements Server
* Endpoint Manager
* Resource Manager
* Node Files Manager
* Minio
* Kafka

### Default Algorithm
The auto-scaling of kubernetes upscales and downscale automatically based upon load. Additional pods are started when the pod average cpu usage exceeds 85% or memory usage exceeds 90%. Every 5 minutes the cluster may shut down pods if average load falls below these scaling limits. Up scaling is generally immediate while downscaling is more infrequent to limit the variability in cluster size.

### Active Web Elements Server Algorithm
In addition to the default above, the scaling of Active Web Elements Server is based on the pools managed by this service. Pod average statistics of the recent peak percentage of kernels in use as well as the queue length of users waiting to access a kernel are collected for each kernel pool managed by the Active Web Elements Server. If for any pool the average kernel usage exceeds 90% or the average queue length exceeds 2 requests,  additional services are launched (as long as the service instance maximum has not been reached). If all the pools average less than 80% kernel usage and queue lengths less than one then pods will be shut down.

**Note:** "Average" here means average across active pods of that particular type.

### Options
By default, there are 2 replicas and they scale up to a maximum of 10.

**How does one change these?**

For each service you can find the appropriate configruation file in `Source/hpa/[service name]-hpa-autoscaler.yaml`. You may alter these configuration values, ensuring a minimum of 2 replicas for each pod.

From the configuration file directory run the following command:

 `kubectl apply -f .`

[Restart](./Documentation/API/Utilities.md) to apply any configuration changes.

## Environment Variables
A number of cluster environment variables are exposed to configure various aspects of the cluster and its services. The source files containing may be found in `source/deployments` on the deployment machine. To modify any environment settings modify the value in te appropriate file. Prior to installing the cluster, these modifications will be used during the installation process. To change a value after the cluster is running, navigate to the directory of the updated source file and  run the following command:

`kubectl apply -f .`

### Service Address Environment Variables

These variables may be changed to configure the public URL's to various services offered by the Wolfram Application Server.

`applicationserver.servername: "http://domain.com/"` - Base URL

`applicationserver.resourcemanager.url: "http://domain.com/resources/"` - Resource manager URL

`applicationserver.nodefilesmanager.url: "http://domain.com/nodefiles/"` - Node files manager URL

`applicationserver.endpointmanager.url: "http://domain.com/endpoints/"` - Endpoint manager URL

`applicationserver.restart.url: "http://domain.com/.applicationserver/kernel/restart"` - Restart API URL

### Kafka Environment Variables
These variables may be changed to configure the Kafka streaming service.

`KAFKA.BOOTSTRAP-SERVERS: kafka-persistent-kafka-bootstrap:9092` - Service and communication port of kafka client


### Active Web Elements Server Environment Variables
These variables may be changed to modify the internal behavior of the Active Web Elements Server.

`APPLICATIONSERVER_CACHEDIRECTORY: /tmp/.wolframcache` - Root directory for locally cached resources

`applicationserver.nodefiles.cachedirectory: /opt/.wolframcache/nodefiles/` - Root directory for all deployed node files


### Kernel Pool Environment Variables
These variables are used to configure pools of Wolfram Engines in the Active Web Elements Server. These kernel pool configurations are stored in a zero offset array where values for each pool follow the naming convention `poolconfiguration_kernelpool_<n>__` with `<n>` being the indext of pool being configured. A minimum of one pool must be configured and it is recommended that at least one pool be named **Public** as this is the pool which will be selected by default when deployed resources do not explicitly declare a pool to use.

The following variables configure a default **Public** pool suitable for serving active web element resources:

`poolconfiguration_kernelpool_0__KernelNumber: "2"` - Number of Wolfram Engines in the pool

`poolconfiguration_kernelpool_0__KernelPoolName: Public` - Name of this pool

`poolconfiguration_kernelpool_0__JLinkEnabled: "false"` - Required for serving active web element resources

This second set of variables configure a pool named **MSP** to serve MSP pages. These resources cannot be served by the previous pool (note that the `JLinkEnabled` value must be set to `"true"` for MSP content).
`poolconfiguration_kernelpool_1__KernelNumber: "2"` - Number of Wolfram Engines in the pool

`poolconfiguration_kernelpool_1__KernelPoolName: MSP` - Name of this pool


`poolconfiguration_kernelpool_1__JLinkEnabled: "true"` - Required for serving MSP resources

Additional pools may be configured if desired using sequentially increasing index values.
